Goal of the game is to survive as long as possible in a growing minefield.

Arrow keys steer your ship, space fires rockets which can destroy the mines. 
Driving off the screen only brings you back around to the other side, there's no getting out.
Rack up the highest score by destroying as many mines as possible before your fuel runs out,
or they destroy you.
